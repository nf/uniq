Implementation and benchmarks of the two methods of generating unique numbers
described in this blog post:
  http://nf.id.au/concurrency-patterns-a-source-of-unique-numbe

The output of 'gomake bench':

uniq.BenchmarkMutex    10000000  173 ns/op
uniq.BenchmarkChannel  10000000  224 ns/op

The channel-based approach takes 1.29x the time of the mutex-based approach.

Depending on the specific application, and your opinion on the aesthetics
of the two approaches, this can be an acceptable tradeoff (it is, IMO).
